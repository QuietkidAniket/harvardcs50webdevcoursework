#all the tables have a id column which is the primary key with auto-increment

flights  has foreign key- code from airportcodes as origin and destination.

airportcodes  has codes for airports.

people  having first and last   ... names.

passengers  has foreign key first name from people as person_id and id from flights as flight_id.

#there exists a many-many relationship between flights and people with 
passengers as the association table as one person can be on many flights and one fligth may have many people.


join query :
SELECT first, origin, destination FROM flights JOIN passengers ON
passengers.flight_id = flights.id;

-> we performed an inner join where we ignore the rows which have no
matches between the tables.
